# Lare1D

---

This is an implementation of the LARE (LAgrangian-REmap) scheme in 1 dimension applied to the inviscid Euler equations for fluid dynamics. The simulation is implemented in C++.

## Building and Running Unit Tests
To build, run `make` in the top level directory. The build files will be placed in `./build`. 

To run unit tests, run `make test`.

## Sample Simulations
The sample simulations so far are
* Riemann Problem

This can be run by running the `run_example.sh` script in the `example` folder using `sh run_example.sh`.
